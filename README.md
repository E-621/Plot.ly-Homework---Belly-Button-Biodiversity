# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

This assignment builds an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The relative abundance of different microbial “species” (technically operational taxonomic units, OTUs) across all the belly buttons sampled. Each pie wedge represents a single species, with the size of the wedge a function of the total abundance of that species (total number of reads). Species can have many occurrences either by being present on many people or being represented by many individuals when present. In practice, the most abundant species in belly buttons are all both found on many people and abundant on those individuals. *(sourced from http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/)
